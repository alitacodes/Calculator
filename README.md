# Calculator
This is a simple calculator that I have made using Python in VS Code. This was my first project and I had written the code in Python IDLE initially and later tried it once in VS Code. It's a nice simple calculator to calculate basic calculations. I have used simple and basic codes that contains a total of 52 lines.
